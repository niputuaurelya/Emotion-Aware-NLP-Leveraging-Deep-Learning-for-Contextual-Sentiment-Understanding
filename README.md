## Abstract

Emotion-Aware NLP has transformed sentiment analysis by leveraging deep learning techniques to understand complex emotional cues in text. Unlike traditional lexicon-based approaches, these models utilize contextual embeddings and transformer architectures (like BERT and GPT) to detect subtle emotions including sarcasm, irony, and multi-label sentiments. This paper presents a deep dive into emotion detection models, their performance on various datasets, and practical applications across industries such as healthcare, customer support, and mental health monitoring. It also outlines current challenges such as bias, computational overhead, and ethical considerations, providing a roadmap for future research in emotionally intelligent AI.
